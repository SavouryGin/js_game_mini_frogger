# Webpack 5 Boilerplate

## Requirements

* `node` : `^10 || ^12 || >=14`
* `npm`

## Build Assets

### One time build assets for development

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Build assets and enable source files watcher

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

This command is suitable if you develop with external web server.

*Note:* Watching does not work with *NFS* (*Windows*) and machines in *VirtualBox*. 
Extend the configuration in such cases by:

```js
module.exports = {
  //...
  watchOptions: {
    poll: 1000 // Check for changes every second
  }
};
```

### Start a development server - reloading automatically after each file change.

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

## Production / Build Assets

* Optimize assets for production by:

```sh
$ npm run production
```
